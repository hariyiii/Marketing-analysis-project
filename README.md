Marketing Performance Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)
Business-Focused Data Analysis Project

Created a dynamic end-to-end marketing performance dashboard using SQL and Power BI to help identify key traffic sources, bounce-heavy landing pages, and conversion trends across an e-commerce site.

Analyzed over 90,000 website sessions to answer 4 core business questions related to traffic trends, landing page performance, quarterly KPIs, and conversion rate analysis.

Segmented sessions by landing pages and UTM sources to uncover high-bounce segments and underperforming acquisition channels.

Calculated key metrics such as Conversion Rate (CVR), Bounce Rate, Average Order Value (AOV), and Revenue by Month, UTM Source, and Referrer.

Designed an interactive dashboard with slicers by year and product to allow dynamic exploration of trends, user behavior, and funnel drop-offs.

Enabled data-driven decision-making by surfacing actionable insights to optimize traffic acquisition strategies and reduce bounce rates.
